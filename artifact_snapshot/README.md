# Manuscript result snapshots

This directory contains compact machine-readable summaries for reported results that are referenced by the manuscript.

Files:

- `oss_fuzz_ge4k_complete10_deep_stats.json`: summary for the 167-case OSS-Fuzz cohort, including the cohort-selection rule, reduction rates, repair pass@k, solved-case counts, relative gains, and patch-locality aggregates.
- `oss_fuzz_case_study_snapshot.json`: traceability snapshot for the OSS-Fuzz motivating example and case studies, including cohort membership, reduction sizes, and per-strategy correct-patch counts.
- `sqlancer_sqlite_main_current_cleanup_summary.json`: summary for the 78-case SQLite SQLancer reduction experiment, including technique-level CR, reduced size, and paired comparisons.
- `lftbench_core_results.json`: compact summary for the LFTBench reducer, repair, prompt-composition, ChatRepair/CREF integration, and reported pass@10 sign-test numbers used in RQ-1 through RQ-4.
- `lftbench_patch_locality_rq2.json`: AED/CCR patch-locality summary for RQ-2 over the LFTBench repair results.
- `check_snapshot_numbers.py`: dependency-free script that prints and sanity-checks the key table numbers, result-paragraph numbers, reported paired sign tests, and snapshot hashes. When run inside the manuscript source tree, it also checks manuscript-source consistency gates.

The files are summary snapshots for result traceability. They support checking the manuscript numbers and do not replace the full experiment artifact.

To check the snapshot values:

```bash
python3 artifact_snapshot/check_snapshot_numbers.py
```
